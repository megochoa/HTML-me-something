      <p>When you think about animal shelters what comes to mind?  The playful puppies, kittens, pets finding their perfect homes, Sarah McLachlen and sad faces?  Sure, some of that is true and some of that happens.  What the public doesn't see is the <span class ="pStyle">heart </span>behind the stories, especially the ones that may not be sensational- or that are too complicated to be shared socially.  The ones that make the biggest impact for me and for others in the field are the ones that help to change views when working with animals and their people.  Here are a few times where that was true for me.</p>

      <h2>The lab/dachshund house</h2>
      <img src="./images/labdoxiepups.jpg" alt="2 brown newborn puppies snuggling"><img src="./images/labdoxieadult.jpg" alt="an adult chocolate lab/dachshund mix smiling for the camera">

      <p>Imagine if you will a dog with a full size lab face and short stubby dachshund bodies.  Now copy and paste that image by 20 and you have this interesting hoarding case!  This case was from a rural MO area where someone had a few dogs that quickly multiplied due to the owners not having access to neuter.</p><p>Many of these dogs were <span class ="pStyle">very</span> poorly socialized and needed a lot of work to get them to be even adoptable.  Aside from that, all were pretty healthy and of a good weight.  Although many people might be angry with these owners and scold them for not reaching out until their pet population was well over double-digits, it is important to remember that the reason why they didn't reach out sooner was probably out of fear of judgment.  In this case we choose compassion.  We built a relationship with these owners and took their pets.  In this case they relinquished all of their dogs because of their health- but other times we will spay and neuter the few they want to keep so this problem doesn't repeat itself. Supporting the previous owners helps us support more pets- although working with owners may not always be easy.</p>

      <h2>The rottweiler siblings</h2>
      <img src="./images/zuesandhera.jpg" alt="2 rottweilers looking at the camera">
      <p>Although some cases call for compassion, others call for justice.  These two dogs were found with embedded collars, old wounds, and other ailments.  They had been poorly socialized and had some negative events in their short lives- they are both under a year old.</p><p>Abuse and neglect cases are a large part of the shelter's population. They also tend to be the most <span class ="pStyle">taxing </span>emotionally and financially to the shelter and staff.  Happily, these two dogs were taken by a breed-specific rescue and their owner was charged with animal cruelty and cannot own an animal for 10 years.  Small wins for the dogs- but a hard situation for sure.</p>
      <h2>Outreach making real differences in the community</h2>

      <p>Happy endings aren't always possible, but to spare you from the truly sad cases, I'll go over another success story.  This is Zubie. He was outside for the first 10 years of his life.  Over those years the outreach team supplied Zubie and his owners with resources to neuter, keep him warm in the winter, and safe from disease.  Eventually Zubie's owners agreed to surrender him!  He was adopted by someone who works at the shelter and has had the absolute <span class ="pStyle">best</span> life since.  He's even won contests for being the "sweetest senior" which landed him on a calendar last year.</p>
